# Parallax effect - Mouseover

How to make a parallax effect when you move the cursos in the screen.
I used JS and CSS to attain that.

## Getting Started

Just add content that you want in the divs that are inside the article with "data-parallax".
```
<article data-parallax class="bg-blue">
      <div>        
        <!-- Content here -->
      </div>
</article>
```
